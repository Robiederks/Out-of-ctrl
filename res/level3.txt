In the top left of you screen, next to each control is a number. That number indicates how many<...>
uses you have left for that control. If it hits 0, you no longer have access to the corresponding<...>
control. Luckily, you can refill the controls by pressing the ctrl key. Just keep in mind you need<...>
one ctrl press for the portal, so do not get OUT OF CTRL!<...>
